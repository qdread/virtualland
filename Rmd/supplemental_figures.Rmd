## Figure S3. Disaggregated production totals

Figure S3 shows the total production, in units of value (billion USD), of each type of domestically produced primary agricultural good in each scenario (in contrast to Figure 2 in the main text, which shows the same values divided by the baseline consumption). Bars representing plant-derived goods are shaded in green, and bars representing animal-derived goods are shaded in pink. Each panel represents a different combination of diet scenario (baseline, three USDA diets, and planetary health diet) and waste scenario (baseline and 50% reduction). *Note*: A similar accounting is not possible for agricultural goods imported from foreign countries because of the different methodology and underlying data used for foreign imports.

## Figure S4. Disaggregated virtual land footprints

Figure S4 shows the virtual land footprint of food consumed in the United States in the baseline scenario and alternative diet and waste scenarios, disaggregated by domestic (blue shading) versus foreign origin (orange shading), with separate totals for annual cropland, pastureland, and permanent cropland. The bars represent total amounts of land virtually consumed in the United States each year, in units of square kilometers per year. Each panel represents a different combination of diet scenario (baseline, three USDA diets, and planetary health diet) and waste scenario (baseline and 50% reduction).

## Figures S5-S11. Disaggregated virtual biodiversity threat footprints

The following figures show the virtual biodiversity threat footprints for the baseline case and the alternative diet and waste scenarios, disaggregated by origin, land use type, and taxon. In all these figures, the heights of the bars represent the number of terrestrial species forecast to eventually become globally extinct due to land used to produce food consumed in the United States. The biodiversity threat footprints are disaggregated by origin (blue shading represents domestic origin and orange shading represents foreign origin) and by land use type. Each panel of each figure represents a different combination of diet scenario (baseline, three USDA diets, and planetary health diet) and waste scenario (baseline and 50% reduction). Figure S5 shows the values for all taxa summed, Figure S6 shows plants only, Figure S7 shows all animal taxa summed, Figure S8 shows amphibians, Figure S9 shows birds, Figure S10 shows mammals, and Figure S11 shows reptiles.

## Figures S12-S33. Maps showing domestic goods production across scenarios

The following groups of figures in this document are all maps showing values spatially disaggregated by county in the United States. In all cases we present absolute values of each of the quantities for each scenario, as well as values relative to the baseline case for each scenario. The colorblind-friendly `viridis` color gradient is used to fill the polygons on the maps showing absolute values. Note that the color gradient represents values on a logarithmic scale.

On the maps showing relative values, a colorblind-friendly `scico` divergent color gradient is used. Blue colors indicate decreases relative to the baseline and reddish-brown colors indicate increases. The starting or ending values of the color gradient are modified in each case so that white color indicates no change relative to baseline. On all maps, gray polygons indicate missing values or zero values that produce negative infinity when log-transformed.

The maps showing differences across scenarios have ten panels, each of which represents a combination of diet scenario (baseline, three USDA diets, and planetary health diet) and waste scenario (baseline and 50% reduction).

The contiguous United States map is displayed with an Albers equal-area projection for the continental United States identical to the one used by the National Land Cover Database. The inset maps for Alaska and Hawaii are displayed with Albers equal-area projections with parameters appropriate for those regions.

Figures S12-S21 show the absolute value of domestic production of the following ten groups of primary agricultural goods, in units of million USD (2012), with a log-transformed color gradient: 

- oilseeds and soybeans
- grains
- vegetables, including melons and potatoes
- fruits and nuts
- greenhouse crops grown for food, including mushrooms
- other crops, primarily sugar crops, peanuts, and herbs
- dairy products
- beef cattle
- poultry and eggs
- other meat, including farm-raised fish

Figure S22 shows the total across the ten groups of goods.

Figures S23-S32 show the total values from the previous set of figures, all divided by the baseline value, resulting in a difference for each scenario relative to the baseline. Figure S33 shows the total relative to baseline.

## Figures S34-S35. Maps showing domestic goods production and consumption, baseline scenario only

The following set of figures shows the baseline scenario only for domestic production and consumption of each of the primary agricultural goods, spatially disaggregated by USA county. Note that foreign-sourced consumption is not included because the breakdown by category of goods does not match the domestic categorization (although the foreign-sourced land and biodiversity footprints are included in the following figures in this document). 

Figure S34 shows the domestic production, by value in million USD, of the ten primary agricultural goods listed above in this document, as well the total. Each panel shows production for a different good. Note that these correspond to the upper left panels of Figures S12-S22.

Figures S35 shows the domestic consumption, by value in million USD, of the same ten goods groups and the total.

## Figures S36-S43. Maps showing virtual land exports across scenarios

The following set of figures shows the total virtual land exports (production) of each county in the United States under all combinations of diet and waste scenario, disaggregated by the type of land use being exported (annual cropland, permanent cropland, pastureland, and total). Virtual land exports are shown in hectares (ha). Layout of panels and other details are the same as in the goods export figures above. Figures S36-S39 show the absolute values for each scenario for the four land types, and Figures S40-S43 the percent change relative to the baseline value.

## Figures S72-S75. Maps showing virtual biodiversity threat exports and imports, baseline scenario only

The following set of figures shows the baseline scenario only for exports and imports of threats to biodiversity for each of the taxonomic groups, spatially disaggregated by USA county. Figure S72 shows production (virtual biodiversity threat exports; note this corresponds to upper left panels of Figures S58-S64), Figure S73 shows domestic-sourced consumption (domestic virtual biodiversity threat imports), Figure S74 shows foreign-sourced consumption (foreign virtual biodiversity threat imports), and Figure S75 shows total consumption from both domestic and foreign sources (total virtual biodiversity threat imports). Values are in units of potential species extinctions. Each of the figures has a separate panel for plants, amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles, total across the four animal taxa, and total across both animals and plants.

## Figures S76-S81. Maps showing foreign virtual biodiversity threat imports to the United States across scenarios

The following set of figures shows the virtual biodiversity threat imports to the United States from all foreign trading partners across all combinations of diet and waste scenarios, both as absolute values in potential species extinctions (Figures S76-S78) and percentage change relative to baseline (Figures S79-S81). A separate figure is shown for imported threats to plants, animals (total across taxa), and total of plant and animal threats. These world maps use the Robinson equal-area projection. Color scales and layout of panels are as described above.
