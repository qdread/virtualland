## Figure S1. Methods graph

This figure graphically shows the relationship between each component in our data synthesis and modeling procedure. Each cluster (blue box with rounded corners) represents a phase of the data synthesis and modeling. Within each cluster, green boxes represent data sources incorporated in that phase, and red boxes represent models used in that phase. In each scenario, the food consumption data are derived from the USDA LAFA dataset, modified by the appropriate set of diet shift and waste reduction scenario parameters. Food consumption determines the required levels of domestic and foreign production (the USEEIO input-output model is used to estimate domestic production, and FAOSTAT trade and production data are used directly for foreign production). Next, the land exchange tables we developed are used to convert domestic production to domestic land footprint, and FAOSTAT yield and food balance sheet data are used for the foreign land footprint. We used the Chaudhary & Brooks model parameterized with IUCN and WWF data to convert the land footprints to biodiversity footprints for each scenario.

## Figure S4. Disaggregated production totals

This figure shows the total production, in units of value (billion USD), of each type of domestically produced primary agricultural good in each scenario (in contrast to Figure 2 in the main text, which shows the same values divided by the baseline consumption). Bars representing plant-derived goods are shaded in green, and bars representing animal-derived goods are shaded in pink. Each panel represents a different combination of diet scenario (baseline, three USDA diets, and planetary health diet) and waste scenario (baseline and 50% reduction). *Note*: A similar accounting is not possible for agricultural goods imported from foreign countries because of the different methodology and underlying data used for foreign imports.

## Figure S5. Disaggregated virtual land footprints

This figure shows the virtual land footprint of food consumed in the United States in the baseline scenario and alternative diet and waste scenarios, disaggregated by domestic (blue shading) versus foreign origin (orange shading), with separate totals for annual cropland, pastureland, and permanent cropland. The bars represent total amounts of land virtually consumed in the United States each year, in units of square kilometers per year. Each panel represents a different combination of diet scenario (baseline, three USDA diets, and planetary health diet) and waste scenario (baseline and 50% reduction).

## Figures S6-S12. Disaggregated virtual biodiversity threat footprints

The following figures show the virtual biodiversity threat footprints for the baseline case and the alternative diet and waste scenarios, disaggregated by origin, land use type, and taxon. In all these figures, the heights of the bars represent the number of terrestrial species forecast to eventually become globally extinct due to land used to produce food consumed in the United States. The biodiversity threat footprints are disaggregated by origin (blue shading represents domestic origin and orange shading represents foreign origin) and by land use type. Each panel of each figure represents a different combination of diet scenario (baseline, three USDA diets, and planetary health diet) and waste scenario (baseline and 50% reduction). Figure S6 shows the values for all taxa summed, Figure S7 shows plants only, Figure S8 shows all animal taxa summed, Figure S9 shows amphibians, Figure S10 shows birds, Figure S11 shows mammals, and Figure S12 shows reptiles.

## Figures S13-S15. Maps showing domestic goods production

The following groups of figures in this document are maps showing values spatially disaggregated by county in the United States. In maps where we present absolute values of each of the quantities for each scenario, we use a colorblind-friendly `viridis` color gradient to fill the polygons on the maps. Note that the color gradient represents values on a logarithmic scale.

On the maps showing relative values, a colorblind-friendly `scico` divergent color gradient is used. Blue colors indicate decreases relative to the baseline and reddish-brown colors indicate increases. The starting or ending values of the color gradient are modified in each case so that white color indicates no change relative to baseline. On all maps, gray polygons indicate missing values or zero values that produce negative infinity when log-transformed.

The maps showing differences across scenarios have ten panels, each of which represents a combination of diet scenario (baseline, three USDA diets, and planetary health diet) and waste scenario (baseline and 50% reduction).

The contiguous United States map is displayed with an Albers equal-area projection for the continental United States identical to the one used by the National Land Cover Database. The inset maps for Alaska and Hawaii are displayed with Albers equal-area projections with parameters appropriate for those regions.

Figure S13 shows the absolute value of domestic production of all primary agricultural goods, in units of million USD (2012), with a log-transformed color gradient. 
Figure S14 shows the total across the ten groups of goods divided by the baseline value, resulting in a difference for each scenario relative to the baseline.
Figure S15 shows the domestic production, by value in million USD, of the following ten primary agricultural goods listed above in this document, as well as the total, for the baseline scenario only. Each panel shows production for a different good.

- oilseeds and soybeans
- grains
- vegetables, including melons and potatoes
- fruits and nuts
- greenhouse crops grown for food, including mushrooms
- other crops, primarily sugar crops, peanuts, and herbs
- dairy products
- beef cattle
- poultry and eggs
- other meat, including farm-raised fish

## Figures S21-S26. Maps showing threatened biodiversity in each county across scenarios

The following set of figures shows the total biodiversity threat associated with food production in each county in the United States under all combinations of diet and waste scenario, with separate figures for plants, the sum of all animal taxa (amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles), and the total of plants and animals. Biodiversity threats are shown in units of number of species threatened by eventual global extinction. Layout of panels and other details are the same as in the goods production figures above. Figures S21-23 show the absolute values for each scenario for each of the taxonomic groups, and Figures S24-26 the percent change relative to the baseline value.
