# Diet shift scenario analysis
# First, load the calories per weight for each of the LAFA categories.
# If all animal products have their calories reduced by 50%, we can replace their calories with (naively) an equal mix
# of all other foods.
# Meat shipments by weight should decrease by 50%
# Calculate the proportion of weight that other food needs to increase by.

# FIXME for now we will assume that the calories are allocated evenly across all the other food groups

# We also need to decrease the shipments of oilcrops and grains (feedstock) to reflect decreased meat consumption
