# Diet shift simulation version 2
# QDR / Virtualland / 07 Dec 2020

# The original way of simulating this was naive, just getting rid of 50% of meat and replacing with evenly divided veg food
# Instead of doing this, and instead of manually doing the linear programming, 
# let's just get the lancet planetary health diet and USA healthy diet guidelines diets.
# See Lancet report (summary), Dietary Guidelines report, and Blackstone et al. which gave me the idea of the approach.


# Read dietary guidelines -----------------------------------

library(tidyverse)

is_local <- dir.exists('Q:/')

fp <- ifelse(is_local, 'Q:', '/nfs/qread-data')
fp_diet <- file.path(fp, 'raw_data/food_consumption/diet_guidelines')

# Read Lancet dietary guidelines

# Read USA dietary guidelines
